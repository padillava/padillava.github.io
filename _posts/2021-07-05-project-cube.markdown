Project Cube: A 3D puzzle adventure is a mobile game developed by a partner and me while we were in ESAT. All of it had been developed in Unity3D and we did from zero, without any specializated asset. We thought about a simple game that could be interesting and fun to play for a while, adding ads for monetization. At the moment, this game is published and available in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ThreeAmTeam.ProjectCube3D">Play Store for free</a>. 

The game consists on reaching the goal of each level in the least amount of movements. It includes 30 leves where we can observe different types of enemies that can kill you. From enemies that only move in one direction and then turn around, to other that move in diagonal. My implication in the developement of this game was the following:

* Gameplay and level design of the complete game.
* Programming of the full gameplay, including player imput and logic of the game.
* Programming of the cube's movements, making it look smooth and attractive for the player.
* Inclusion of the levels in a database for an easy escalation of the game, so it could be easy to add more levels.
