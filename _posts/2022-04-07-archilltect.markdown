Archilltect: A 3D puzzle adventure is a mobile game developed by a friend and me. All of it had been developed in Unity3D and we did from zero, without any specializated asset. We thought about a simple game that could be interesting and fun to play for a while, with some challenging levels. At the moment, this game is published and available in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BadwazGames.ARCHILLTECT">Play Store for free</a>. 

The game consists on choose where to put all the buildings available with each of those buildings having a specific set of rules. Each building has a color and a type, making possible multiple solutions to most of the levels. My implication in the developement of this game was the following:

* Gameplay and level design of the complete game.
* Programming of the full gameplay, including player input and logic of the game.
* Programming of the solution checking for each type of building.
