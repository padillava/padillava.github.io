Game based on the game from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/212800/Super_Crate_Box/">Steam</a> Super Crate Box. The game tries to imitate the mechanics of the original game, trying to get the same feeling when the player is playing either of the games. Jumping, running, shooting... All of them try to imitate the original. It includes:

* The three type of enemies from the original. Once they fall down they appear on top angry.
* Random places to spawn boxes.
* 6 types of weapons from the original game. Pistol, Uzi, Shotgun, Mines, Rocket Launcher and Revolver.
