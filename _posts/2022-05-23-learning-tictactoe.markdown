A little project to make an AI that learns while playing against you. By trial and error it starts to learn how to not lose the game until finally, after muliple plays, it's able to recreate the last games to not lose and try to win. You are able to dowload the game from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aEfJU4ANcxNd_YE_bT-0igrulLoRghfy/view?usp=sharing">here.</a>. 

The features of this project are:

* At random, either you or the AI start the game.
* You can restart the game at any moment.
* You can decide if the AI learns or not from the matches.
* You can reset the AI so it starts to learn again from zero.
